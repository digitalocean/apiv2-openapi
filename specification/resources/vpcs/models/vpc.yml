      description: The range of IP addresses in the VPC in CIDR notation.
        Network ranges cannot overlap with other networks in the same account
          and must be in range of private addresses as defined in RFC1918. It
          may not be smaller than `/24` nor larger than `/16`. If no IP range
          is specified, a `/20` network range is generated that won't conflict
          with other VPC networks in your account.
