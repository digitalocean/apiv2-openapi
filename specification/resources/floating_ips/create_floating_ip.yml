    request to `/v2/floating_ips` with the `droplet_id` attribute.

  * To create a new floating IP reserved to a region, send a POST request to
    `/v2/floating_ips` with the `region` attribute.

  **Note**:  In addition to the standard rate limiting, only 12 floating IPs may
  be created per 60 seconds.
