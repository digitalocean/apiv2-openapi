  ## Attach a Block Storage Volume to a Droplet

  | Attribute   | Details                                                             |
  | ----------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------- |
  | type        | This must be `attach`                                               |
  | volume_name | The name of the block storage volume                                |

  | region      | Set to the slug representing the region where the volume is located |

  Each volume may only be attached to a single Droplet. However, up to five
  volumes may be attached to a Droplet at a time. Pre-formatted volumes will be
  automatically mounted to Ubuntu, Debian, Fedora, Fedora Atomic, and CentOS
  Droplets created on or after April 26, 2018 when attched. On older Droplets,
  [additional configuration](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-partition-and-format-digitalocean-block-storage-volumes-in-linux#mounting-the-filesystems)
  is required.
