summary: Run App Detection

description: |-
  Given a git repository, app detection will scan it for supported types of applications and return the first match. You can use this information to aid in the creation of app specifications.

  You may specify either a branch in the source spec or a specific commit hash. Use `git` OR `gitlab` OR `github`. Additionally, you may pass a preferred component type to target. For documentation on app specifications (`AppSpec` objects), please refer to [the product documentation](https://www.digitalocean.com/docs/app-platform/references/app-specification-reference/).
