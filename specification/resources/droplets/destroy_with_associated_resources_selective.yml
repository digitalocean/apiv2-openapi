summary: Selectively Destroy a Droplet and its Associated Resources

description: |
  To destroy a Droplet along with a sub-set of its associated resources, send a
  DELETE request to the `/v2/droplets/$DROPLET_ID/destroy_with_associated_resources/selective`
  endpoint. The JSON body of the request should include `snapshots`, `volumes`,
  or `volume_snapshots` keys each set to an array of IDs for the associated
  resources to be destroyed. The IDs can be found by querying the Droplet's
  associated resources. Any associated resource not included in the request
  will remain and continue to accrue changes on your account.

  A successful response will include a 202 response code and no content. Use
  the status endpoint to check on the success or failure of the destruction of
  the individual resources.
