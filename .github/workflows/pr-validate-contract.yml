    # This job runs a postman collection through the newman cli 
    # targeting a prism proxy instance which proxies to a prism mock 
    # (all generated from or referencing the spec file)
    
    # The purpose is to perform initial validation of the requests and responses against the spec definition for the proposed changes.
    # Given that this is using a mock api, the results should not be considered difinitive at this stage.
