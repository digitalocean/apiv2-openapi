# apiv2-openapi
OpenAPI v3 specification for DigitalOcean's public API v2.

## What's this?

We are writing an OpenAPI v3 spec for our existing [APIv2](https://developers.digitalocean.com/documentation/v2/). Due to customer requests for an OpenAPI v3 spec, we decided to share our work as we go and will start releasing release candidates as we complete useful sets of endpoints.

Right now, the repo contains our working files, which you can clone and browse using VS Code or any other editor that has robust support for `$ref`. We will also be providing a single file (bundled) version of the spec in the near future, as well as a Postman collection.

We would love to hear from you how you plan to use the spec as well as any other spec related feedback you might like to provide in the issues.
