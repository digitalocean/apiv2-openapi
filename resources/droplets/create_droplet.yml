summary: Create a New Droplet

description: |
  To create a new Droplet, send a POST request to `/v2/droplets` setting the
  required attributes.

  A Droplet will be created using the provided information. The response body
  will contain a JSON object with a key called `droplet`. The value will be an
  object containing the standard attributes for your new Droplet. The response
  code, 202 Accepted, does not indicate the success or failure of the operation,
  just that the request has been accepted for processing. The `actions` returned
  as part of the response's `links` object can be used to check the status
  of the Droplet create event.
