summary: Delete an Existing Droplet

description: |
  To delete a Droplet, send a DELETE request to `/v2/droplets/$DROPLET_ID`.

  A successful request will receive a 204 status code with no body in response.
  This indicates that the request was processed successfully.

  ### Deleting Droplets by Tag

  It's possible to delete multiple Droplets with a single request by including
  certain query parameters. To delete **all** Droplets assigned to a specific
  tag, include the `tag_name` query parameter set to the name of the tag in
  your DELETE request. For example, `/v2/droplets?tag_name=$TAG_NAME`.
