  The response will be a JSON object with a key set to image. 
  The value of this will be an image object containing a subset of the standard image attributes as listed below, including the image's id and status. 
  After initial creation, the status will be NEW. 
  Using the image's id, you may query the image's status by sending a GET request to the /v2/images/$IMAGE_ID endpoint. 
  When the status changes to available, the image will be ready for use.
